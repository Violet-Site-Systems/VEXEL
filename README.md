# VEXEL 🌉

A DID Bridge Layer creating sovereign interoperability across distributed identity systems. VEXEL connects decentralized identifiers across ecosystems, enabling autonomous, cross-chain identity bridging while preserving cryptographic sovereignty. No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just pure, protocol-level identity freedom.
