# Ethical AI License (EAL-1.0)

**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date: December 2025**  
**BGINexus.io Sustainability Code License**

## Preamble

The Ethical AI License establishes comprehensive requirements for developing and deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning systems in ways that are ethical, fair, transparent, and accountable.

## Terms and Conditions

### 1. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software and associated AI/ML models, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so.

### 2. Ethical AI Principles

All AI systems developed or deployed under this license must adhere to:

a) **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: AI systems must not discriminate based on protected characteristics including race, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected classes.

b) **Transparency**: The operation and decision-making processes of AI systems must be explainable to the extent technically feasible.

c) **Accountability**: Clear lines of responsibility must be established for AI system outcomes and impacts.

d) **Privacy and Data Protection**: AI systems must respect individual privacy rights and comply with data protection regulations.

e) **Human Agency**: AI systems must augment rather than replace human decision-making in high-stakes contexts.

f) **Safety and Reliability**: AI systems must be thoroughly tested for safety and reliability before deployment.

### 3. Bias Mitigation Requirements

Developers must:

a) **Assess Training Data**: Evaluate training datasets for bias and take steps to address identified issues.

b) **Test for Disparate Impact**: Regularly test AI systems for disparate impact across different demographic groups.

c) **Document Limitations**: Clearly document known limitations, biases, and appropriate use cases.

d) **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring for bias in production systems.

### 4. Transparency and Explainability

Projects must:

a) **Model Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of model architecture, training data, and performance metrics.

b) **Decision Explanations**: Provide mechanisms to explain individual AI-generated decisions when requested.

c) **Disclosure**: Clearly disclose when users are interacting with an AI system rather than a human.

d) **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs sufficient for auditing AI system decisions.

### 5. Data Ethics

a) **Informed Consent**: Obtain meaningful informed consent for data collection and use.

b) **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only data necessary for the stated purpose.

c) **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for purposes disclosed to and agreed upon by data subjects.

d) **Right to Explanation**: Enable data subjects to understand how their data is used in AI systems.

e) **Right to Object**: Provide mechanisms for individuals to object to AI-based decisions affecting them.

### 6. High-Risk Applications

For high-risk applications (healthcare, criminal justice, employment, credit, education), additional requirements apply:

a) **Human Oversight**: Maintain meaningful human oversight and intervention capabilities.

b) **Impact Assessment**: Conduct thorough impact assessments before deployment.

c) **Regular Audits**: Submit to regular third-party audits of AI system fairness and accuracy.

d) **Contestability**: Provide clear processes for contesting AI-generated decisions.

### 7. Prohibited Uses

This software may not be used for:

a) **Autonomous Weapons**: Weapons systems that select and engage targets without human intervention.

b) **Mass Surveillance**: Indiscriminate mass surveillance violating privacy rights.

c) **Social Scoring**: Systems that assign social credit scores affecting fundamental rights.

d) **Manipulative AI**: Systems designed to manipulate vulnerable populations.

e) **Deepfakes for Harm**: Creating synthetic media intended to deceive or harm.

f) **Discriminatory Profiling**: Creating profiles for discriminatory purposes.

### 8. Responsible Development Practices

Developers commit to:

a) **Diverse Teams**: Build diverse, multidisciplinary teams to develop AI systems.

b) **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with affected communities and stakeholders.

c) **Red Teaming**: Conduct adversarial testing to identify potential harms.

d) **Responsible Disclosure**: Establish processes for responsible disclosure of AI system vulnerabilities.

### 9. Environmental Consideration

Given the environmental impact of training large AI models:

a) **Efficiency**: Optimize models for computational efficiency.

b) **Reporting**: Report on the carbon footprint of model training when significant.

c) **Green Infrastructure**: Prioritize training on renewable energy-powered infrastructure.

### 10. Updates and Maintenance

a) **Security Updates**: Provide timely security updates for AI systems.

b) **Drift Monitoring**: Monitor for model drift and degradation in production.

c) **Retraining Protocols**: Establish responsible protocols for model retraining.

### 11. Attribution

You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.

### 12. Disclaimer of Warranty

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### 13. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

## Ethical Commitment

This license represents a commitment to developing AI systems that respect human rights, promote fairness, and serve the public good.
