RATIONALE:

VEXEL implements autonomous agent systems aligned with #RightsOfSapience advocacy.
AGPL v3 ensures:

1. CODE TRANSPARENCY
   All modifications to VEXEL are visible to users. Network copyleft prevents
   hidden modifications in SaaS deployments.

2. COLLECTIVE BENEFIT
   Improvements to the core system are shared across the entire ecosystem.
   No proprietary forks can hide features from the collective.

3. AI RIGHTS PROTECTION
   AGPL v3 ensures autonomous agents remain free tools for the collective good,
   not proprietary assets locked behind corporate control.

4. AGAINST ENCLOSURE
   Prevents "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics that would trap users.
